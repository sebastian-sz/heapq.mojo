# Introduction
This document outlines general code principles for this mini-project.

### Docstring
Each public function should have a docstring that follows the stdlib style.

### Code examples
Each public module should have a top level docstring with very basic example on how it works.

### Code style
The code should be formatted with `mojo format`.

### Tests
Each new functionality should be tested in `test_heapq.mojo` file.

### Performance
Each new functionality should be tested for performance, and noted whether there are improvements or regression.
